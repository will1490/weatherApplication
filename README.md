The Mission

---

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.
Specifications
ðŸŒ± Must haves

---

    Do an autocomplete and display cities that start with what the user started typing in the input, you will have to go through another API that only returns cities, for example: https://api-ninjas.com /api/city

    In the home page the user can enter the city of their choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
    On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days

    ðŸ’¡ Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves (in no specific order)

    Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
    Allow the user to compare the weather in multiple cities simultaneously
    Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.
    Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js
